# Personal Portfolio Site

This is the repository for my personal website, found [here.](http://www.samvredenburgh.com/)

It was built using the Yeoman Angular Generator for the client side, and a Node/Express backend with API routes serving data.

[This](http://start.jcolemorrison.com/building-an-angular-and-express-app-part-1/) tutorial greatly helped the creation process.

This project is currently depoyed through the Google App Engine.

Stretch Goals:

1. Connect to MongoDB with mongoose integration.

2. Another pass at mobile styling.

3. Incorporate more pages using ngRoute.

4. Unit testing as part of the build process.
